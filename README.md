# Pewlett-Hackard
The ERD png diagrams the relationships between the tables that are then created in the pwelett-hackard.sql file. The analysis.sql creates display tables with the requested information, and gives a brief description of what is being displayed. 

The Jupyter Notebook imports the SQL database and creates a grouped histogram for salary ranges. It also groups by position and creates an average salary bar chart. Both the histogram and the bar chart are also available as pngs.
